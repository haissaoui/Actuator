This is an essay to create an all-in-one tool for actuaries.  
## Time Value of Money (TVM) Calculator
This project aims to build a TVM calculator inspired by the Texas Instruments BA II Plus calculator, a popular financial calculator used in business and finance. The calculator will be able to perform various financial calculations, including time-value-of-money, discounted cash flow analysis, bond price/yield calculations, and amortization schedules.

The calculator will have a user-friendly interface, making it easy to perform financial calculations, and will be built using a modern programming language, such as Python or JavaScript. The calculator will also have a comprehensive set of instructions and examples to help users understand the various financial concepts and calculations involved.

This project will be an excellent opportunity to learn about financial calculations and develop your programming skills. Whether you're a finance professional or student, this project will give you the chance to build a valuable tool that you can use in your everyday work.
